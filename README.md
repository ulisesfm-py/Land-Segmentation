# Agriculture-Land-Classification
Image Downloading / DataSet Creation / Classification model creation / Create own mask of land use

### This is a guided course from [Cognitiveclass.ai](https://courses.cognitiveclass.ai/)

This course uses aerial and satellite photographs of the earth's surface. We'll build our own photo masks based on ready-made masks and siplay them on the screen.

### Introduction 

Determining how land is used is a huge problem today. After all, its improper and illegal use can lead to both economic and natural disasters. One of the ways to assess the use is the analysis of aerial and satellite images of the earth's surface. A big problem is to build a mathematical model that can determine the type of land use based on colors. If you have ready-made photos and masks of land use, you can use the methods of artificial intelligence and big data to build a model-classifier.

In this lab, we will learn how to upload photos, transform pixels and colors into a data set. Then we will learn how to build a classifier and predict land use masks based on it.
